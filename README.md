# 👋 Hi, I'm Liam Donovan — aka EekML

I'm a 15 y/o student in the UK passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Computer Science**, and **Cognitive Science**.  
I'm self-studying **GCSE Further Maths** and **AQA Computer Science**, and I'm building real projects along the way.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 📁 Python mini-projects (CLI tools, file managers, flashcard quiz apps)
- 🧠 Machine learning tools (data parsers, simple ML pipelines)
- 🧪 Cognitive experiments (aphantasia, lucid dreaming, attention training)
- 📈 Building a portfolio to showcase my skills before A-levels

---

## 📚 Skills & Tools

- 🐍 Python (beginner–intermediate)
- 🧮 Mathematics (Single Variable Calculus, Vectors, Algebra, Trigonometry, Probability, ML structures and architectures)
- 📊 Git, GitHub, Markdown
- 🧠 Interest in neuroscience, attention systems, machine learning
- 🌐 Starting to learn web (HTML/CSS soon for portfolio)

---

## 🧱 Current Learning Goals

- 🧠 Dive deeper into machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pytorch)
- 📈 Build personal data science scripts (CSV parsers, visualizers)
- 📘 Improve Python architecture (OOP, clean structure, testing)
- 💻 Contribute to open source projects by 16
